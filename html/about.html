            <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener,
                either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as
                strawberries
                or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below
                the
                freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from
                forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result
                is
                a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more
                malleable as its temperature increases.

                Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held
                by
                the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an
                ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked
                items
                such as Baked Alaska.</p>
